# Pinspiration: A Pinterest Clone:

This project is a web application inspired by Pinterest, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to explore a feed of images and features a search bar with auto-suggestions.

## Features:
- Image Feed: Fetches images from an external source (replace with your actual implementation) and displays them in a grid layout.
- Search Bar: Provides an input field where users can type their search queries.
- Auto-Suggestions: As the user types, the application suggests relevant search terms based on their input. The suggestions should update dynamically.
